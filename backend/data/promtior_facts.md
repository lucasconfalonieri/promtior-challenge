# Promtior Facts

## Company Background
Promtior was founded in May 2023 in direct response to the accelerated adoption pressure created by the rise of large-scale generative AI systems such as ChatGPT (released publicly in November 2022).

The founders identified that emerging AI tools were challenging previously unquestionable assumptions, such as:
- "Creativity is an exclusively human trait."
- "AI is not yet mature enough to affect core business models."

After ChatGPT, leadership teams in many companies started facing unprecedented urgency to integrate AI into their organizations. Promtior was created in that context to help them do it in a strategic and safe way.

## Mission / Value Proposition
Promtior helps organizations navigate a scenario of transversal disruption caused by generative AI and turn that disruption into concrete opportunities.

The company’s work focuses on:
- Bringing companies to the forefront of their sector by adopting GenAI.
- Designing new business models enabled by AI.
- Defining how AI should be incorporated across the organization, not just as isolated experiments.

## Services (high-level positioning)
Promtior provides both technological and organizational consulting around AI, with a strong focus on:
- Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants tailored to client knowledge and processes.
- Helping companies safely adopt generative AI into real workflows.
- Turning AI from “a hype topic” into an operational capability that supports decision-making and efficiency.

  "How do we approach an environment of transversal disruption and maximize the opportunities it creates?"
